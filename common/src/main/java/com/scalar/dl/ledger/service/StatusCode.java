/**
 * Status code of registration or execution requests to ledger.
 *
 * <p>The 2xx class of status code indicates that the request has succeeded.
 *
 * <p>The 3xx class of status code indicates that an asset record in the database is in an invalid
 * state and possibly tampered.
 *
 * <p>The 4xx class of status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request
 * due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., invalid signature, invalid key
 * pair, execution error inside contracts or contract is not found).
 *
 * <p>The 5xx class of status code indicates that the ledger server encountered an unexpected
 * condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
 *
 * <p>The 6xx class of status code indicates that the client encountered an unexpected condition
 * that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
