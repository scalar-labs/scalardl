Scalar DL is a blockchain-inspired distributed ledger platform software, which achieves:

- High tamper-evidence of data by utilizing digital signature, hash chain, determinism and decentralization
- Scalable and highly available ACID-compliant smart contract executions
- Exact finality and linearizable consistency
